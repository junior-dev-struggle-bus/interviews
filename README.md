# Problem Solving for Technical Interviews

Code examples and slide decks for JDSB's interview workshop, held Jan-Mar 2020.

## About this workshop

The Junior Dev Struggle Bus is thrilled to bring a new workshop series 
to our community. We hope that the workshop helps to orient our 
diverse community of new developers in core computer science paradigms.

The workshop is focused on understanding and implementing 
common data structures and algorithms. Each session will address a 
standalone topic and culminate in common technical interview questions 
for that topic.

The topics we will cover include:
* General problem-solving strategies
* Arrays
* Sorting algorithms
* Linked lists (singly- and doubly-linked)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
  * Binary trees
  * BSTs
  * K-nary trees
* Graphs
